    </p>
    <p>I have never had a budget in my life. I have always worked to live, and I have considered each and every paycheck to be a giant pile of fun money. Throw in a “everyone needs credit” mentality into the mix, and you have a powder keg of debt waiting to explode. If I hope to live free of debt, have peace of mind, and build any sort of wealth - then I definitely need a budget. For the first time in my life I am taking steps towards that goal.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-need-a-budget-and-you-might-too">Why I need a budget (and you might too)</h2>

<p>At the ripe old age of 28, I have had a fairly successful career in software engineering. If we are looking at salary alone, by all accounts my family and I should be just fine. However, I have learned a few tricks to making my income work against me.</p>

<p>Credit cards, a mortgage, a mounting pile of online subscriptions, and a “spend first, never ask questions later” mentality have given my family several televisions, 2 playstations, an xbox, and absolutely no hope of retirement.</p>

<p>Increased salary has never addressed the problem, and I have a feeling this is the case for a lot of people. Historically, as my income has increased, so has my spending. It isn’t terribly difficult to spend money when it’s available.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>As stated earlier, I’m a software developer. Whenever I want to learn something new in the realm of software, I find an expert, grab a book, and start applying the principles. Budgeting seemed like it could operate on the same level. My good friend and co-blogger Jason pointed me towards Dave Ramsey and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411090654&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=total+money+makeover">Total Money Makeover</a> book.</p>

<p>There is a lot of practical advice in this book, and reading it has been a catalyst for action and has given me a general interest in the practice of budgeting and setting financial goals. </p>

<h3 id="the-envelope-system">The envelope system</h3>
<p>The envelope system is one recommended by Dave. The idea is you put fixed amounts of <strong>physical</strong> money, inside of <strong>physical</strong> envelopes. Spend from the envelopes and when the money is gone, you are done.</p>

<p>My wife Jennie and I have been setting down the budget together and have been filling the following envelopes with a fixed amount of cash: grocery, baby, clothing, hospitality, date night, and discretionary. Once the envelope is depleted, we just have to deal with it.</p>

<p>The envelope system is one idea that I was a little skeptical of at first. I live and breath in a digital world, so the concept of physical money in a physical envelope felt unnatural to me. The real value has been breaking bad old habits, and learning new beneficial ones.</p>

<p>The side effects of this simple practice are amazing. It has allowed us to have an ACTUAL plan.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>I’m not entirely convinced that <em>physical</em> is the best method, and this new way of life has certainly given me some food for thought on how technology might simplify this process - thinking in the vein of services like Mint, but maybe with an easier touch.</p>
