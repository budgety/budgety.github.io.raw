   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have never had a budget in my life. I have always worked to live, and I have considered each and every paycheck to be a giant pile of fun money. Throw in a “everyone needs credit” mentality into the mix, and you have a powder keg of debt waiting to explode. If I hope to live free of debt, have peace of mind, and build any sort of wealth - then I definitely need a budget. For the first time in my life I am taking steps towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-need-a-budget-and-you-might-too&quot;&gt;Why I need a budget (and you might too)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the ripe old age of 28, I have had a fairly successful career in software engineering. If we are looking at salary alone, by all accounts my family and I should be just fine. However, I have learned a few tricks to making my income work against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit cards, a mortgage, a mounting pile of online subscriptions, and a “spend first, never ask questions later” mentality have given my family several televisions, 2 playstations, an xbox, and absolutely no hope of retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased salary has never addressed the problem, and I have a feeling this is the case for a lot of people. Historically, as my income has increased, so has my spending. It isn’t terribly difficult to spend money when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, I’m a software developer. Whenever I want to learn something new in the realm of software, I find an expert, grab a book, and start applying the principles. Budgeting seemed like it could operate on the same level. My good friend and co-blogger Jason pointed me towards Dave Ramsey and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1411090654&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=total+money+makeover&quot;&gt;Total Money Makeover&lt;/a&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of practical advice in this book, and reading it has been a catalyst for action and has given me a general interest in the practice of budgeting and setting financial goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-envelope-system&quot;&gt;The envelope system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The envelope system is one recommended by Dave. The idea is you put fixed amounts of &lt;strong&gt;physical&lt;/strong&gt; money, inside of &lt;strong&gt;physical&lt;/strong&gt; envelopes. Spend from the envelopes and when the money is gone, you are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife Jennie and I have been setting down the budget together and have been filling the following envelopes with a fixed amount of cash: grocery, baby, clothing, hospitality, date night, and discretionary. Once the envelope is depleted, we just have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The envelope system is one idea that I was a little skeptical of at first. I live and breath in a digital world, so the concept of physical money in a physical envelope felt unnatural to me. The real value has been breaking bad old habits, and learning new beneficial ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side effects of this simple practice are amazing. It has allowed us to have an ACTUAL plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely convinced that &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; is the best method, and this new way of life has certainly given me some food for thought on how technology might simplify this process - thinking in the vein of services like Mint, but maybe with an easier touch.&lt;/p&gt;
