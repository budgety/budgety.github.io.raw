I have never had a budget in my life. I have always worked to live, and I have considered each and every paycheck to be a giant pile of fun money. Throw in a “everyone needs credit” mentality into the mix, and you have a powder keg of debt waiting to explode. 

If I hope to live free of debt, have peace of mind, and build any sort of wealth - then I definitely need a budget. For the first time in my life I am taking steps towards that goal.

##Why I need a budget (and you might too)

At the ripe old age of 28, I have had a fairly successful career in software engineering. If we are looking at salary alone, by all accounts my family and I should be just fine. However, I have learned a few tricks to making my income work against me.

Credit cards, a mortgage, a mounting pile of online subscriptions, and a "spend first, never ask questions later" mentality have given my family several televisions, 2 playstations, an xbox, and absolutely no hope of retirement.

Increased salary has never addressed the problem, and I have a feeling this is the case for a lot of people. Historically, as my income has increased, so has my spending. It isn’t terribly difficult to spend money when it's available.

##Getting started

As stated earlier, I'm a software developer. Whenever I want to learn something new in the realm of software, I find an expert, grab a book, and start applying the principles. Budgeting seemed like it could operate on the same level. My good friend and co-blogger Jason pointed me towards Dave Ramsey and his [Total Money Makeover](http://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411090654&sr=1-1&keywords=total+money+makeover) book.

There is a lot of practical advice in this book, and reading it has been a catalyst for action and has given me a general interest in the practice of budgeting and setting financial goals. 

### The envelope system
The envelope system is one recommended by Dave. The idea is you put fixed amounts of **physical** money, inside of **physical** envelopes. Spend from the envelopes and when the money is gone, you are done.

My wife Jennie and I have been setting down the budget together and have been filling the following envelopes with a fixed amount of cash: grocery, baby, clothing, hospitality, date night, and discretionary. Once the envelope is depleted, we just have to deal with it.

The envelope system is one idea that I was a little skeptical of at first. I live and breath in a digital world, so the concept of physical money in a physical envelope felt unnatural to me. The real value has been breaking bad old habits, and learning new beneficial ones.

The side effects of this simple practice are amazing. It has allowed us to have an ACTUAL plan.

##The Future

I’m not entirely convinced that *physical* is the best method, and this new way of life has certainly given me some food for thought on how technology might simplify this process - thinking in the vein of services like Mint, but maybe with an easier touch.
